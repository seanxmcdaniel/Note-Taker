  ## Installation
  
  The note taker requires no installations. 
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use the note taker app, simply fill in the note title and the note text with the notes and reminders of your choice. Once you fill in the note, hit the save button in the top right-hand corner to save your note. Once your note is saved, it will appear in the column to the left. You can re-open that note by clicking on it in the column. To add a new note, click the "+" button in the top far right corner. To delete a saved note, click the small red delete logo within the column on the left side.
